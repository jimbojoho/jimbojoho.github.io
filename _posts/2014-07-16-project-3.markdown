description: When I first arrived in Hong Kong, I came across a job advert that was looking for a new designer to work at a company producing a lifestyle magazine. I didn't have much or a portfolio at the time, so I decided to show the company that I was capable by mocking up a potential design for their magazine (keeping the cover page fairly similar to waht they were already producing) I was quickly offered a job; dissapointingly, at the time the company were unable to sponsor a working visa application.
