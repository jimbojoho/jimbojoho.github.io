description: Initially, Sophia wanted a custom built website with some complex functionality such as an online booking form, but there was not enough budget to accomodate building something like that from the ground up. Upon consultation, I suggested that she go down the route of an online website builder and we both agreed that GoDaddy's new website building tool would deliver what she needed on her site. I helped Sophia by setting up her account, editing pictures, designing the page layout and helped explain how to use the CMS so she could update the site herself in the future.
